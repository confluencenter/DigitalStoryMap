# MapApp V10 - 3D Globe Story Map

[DEMO OF THE MAPP APP](https://adamfehse.github.io/mapappv10/)

Interactive 3D globe for exploring Arizona-Sonora borderlands research and art projects.

  1. Artists need money
  2. Researchers have access to money (through Gov. funding)
  3. Researchers need artists' work

We bring artists, researchers, and community members together with a shareable, engaging social platform.

Designed with multiplexing in mind. Native ES6 modules give the modular experience. Performant across devices and connections and should be browser compatible.

No backend. No servers were hurt in making this.
No build, all CDN.

It was built for the Confluencenter for [Creative Inquiry at the University of Arizona](https://confluencenter.arizona.edu/) with CORAZON and GitHub Pages.
